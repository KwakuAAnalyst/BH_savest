          <h2>Step 1: Sign up or Connect Your Wallet</h2>
          <p>
            To transact using BlockHolder, you'll need a digital wallet. A wallet is your gateway to accessing decentralized applications and managing your funds securely. Choose one of the following options:
          </p><br></br>
          <ul>
            <li>New User? Create a Wallet: Choose from popular wallet providers like Coinbase Wallet, MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or any Web3-compatible wallet of your choice.</li> <br></br>
            <li>Existing User? Connect Your Wallet: Click on "Connect Wallet" and select your preferred wallet. Ensure that it is funded with the base currency (e.g., ETH, BNB, etc.) to cover transaction fees.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className={styles.tip}>
            Tip: Always double-check that you're connecting to the official BlockHolder URL to avoid phishing scams.
